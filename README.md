# Welcome to The Red:4 Repository

This is the source code for Big Machine's "Take Off With Elixir" book and video. Feel free to browse the code and leave feedback of any kind.

The code is organized by chapter/video number so you should be able to find the thing you're looking for. I hope. 

## Update 2022

Elixir has changed a bit since this video was created in 2015. I've updated the demos and you can read [a full description here](https://github.com/bigmachine-io/taking-off/discussions/14).

All the code should compile with the latest Elixir bits but, as you'll see, there are some gotchas in the tests that you'll need to work out!
